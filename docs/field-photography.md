# Field Photography

## Purpose

Field photos are for documenting context, habitat, and macroscopic features. They can also be used for length-only annotations when a scale is available.

## Importing Field Photos

1. In **Prepare Images**, select images.
2. Set **Image type** to **Field**.
3. If the image has EXIF date/GPS, use **Set from current image** to populate observation metadata.

## Measuring Lengths in Field Images

- Select **Category: Field** in the Measure tab.
- Use the **Line** tool (two clicks) to annotate length.
- If no scale is set, measurements are relative; set a scale if you need real units.

## Tips

- Use a consistent camera or include a scale reference when possible.
- Capture multiple angles and include a context shot.
- Keep filenames intact for easier tracking.
