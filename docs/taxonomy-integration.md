# Taxonomy Integration

## Common Names and Scientific Names

- Enter a common name and MycoLog will look up matching taxonomy.
- Genus and species fields provide suggestions as you type.

## AI Suggestions

MycoLog can query Artsdatabanken (Artsorakelet) to suggest species based on images.

- Use AI suggestions as guidance, not as a definitive ID.
- You can crop images for better results.

## Reference Values

Reference values can be linked to specific species and sources, and plotted alongside your observations.
