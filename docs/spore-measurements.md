# Spore Measurements

## Measurement Modes

- **Rectangle**: four clicks to define length and width for spores.
- **Line**: two clicks to measure length only.

## Categories

Common categories include **Spores** and **Field**. Categories determine how measurements are grouped and plotted.

## Reviewing Measurements

- Select a row in the measurements table to preview.
- Adjust lines and apply changes in the preview pane.
- Delete unwanted measurements from the table.

## Analysis

- Scatter plot shows length vs width.
- Histograms (optional) show distributions.
- Confidence ellipse can be shown for datasets with point measurements.

## Reference Data

- Add multiple reference datasets and toggle them in the plot table.
- Legend labels include genus initial and source, e.g. `G. marginata (Pedersen)`.
- Use **Add** and **Edit** to manage reference datasets.

## Export

### Observation Export

- **Export plot**: saves the current analysis plot (scatter + optional histograms).
- **Export gallery**: creates an annotated thumbnail mosaic for the active observation.
- **Copy stats / Save stats**: exports summary statistics plus a tab-separated table of raw measurements.

These actions live in the **Output** section of the Analysis tab and use the currently selected observation and category.
